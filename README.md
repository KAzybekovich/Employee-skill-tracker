📝 Description

The Employee Skill Tracker is a Java-based console application designed to manage employees and their skill sets. It allows users to add, update, delete, and view employee records along with the skills associated with each employee. The system also supports generating analytical reports and exporting/importing data in both CSV and JSON formats.

The project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and follows a modular design for better code organization and scalability.
